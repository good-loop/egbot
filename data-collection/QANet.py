## data processer

## embedder
# where the text inputs (paragraphs and questions) are converted into representations in the form of dense low-dimensional vectors. 
# the approach is done using character-aware neural language models, paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.06615.pdf

## encoding 

## attention
# QANet uses trilinear attention function used in BiDAF paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.01603.pdf
