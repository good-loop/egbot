if M does not intersect the interval $[a_1, s=a_1+a_2..a_n]$ then any permutation $\sigma$ would do. so we assume that max M is less or equal to s.

choose the initial step $a_j$ where j is the smallest index j so that $a_j$ is not in M. this is possible because M has only n-1 elements. now replace the set M by $M_1 = M – a_j = m – a_j: m in M$, remove $a_j$ and set $\sigma_1 = j.$

8984,10506,"However, since there is absolutely no reason to be able to do that on the first step, I think this is probably not the way to go. I’m tempted to try proving it for n=3 by an ugly method. In fact, here is an attempt at that. Let the numbers be a,b and $c$. We’re trying to get to a+b+c. Let’s write down the first two steps of all six possible routes: (a,a+b), (a,a+c), (b,b+a), (b,b+c), (c,c+a), (c,c+b). Can we find two numbers that intersect all these pairs?

The answer isn’t instantly obvious, so let’s experiment with blocking a and b+c to see what happens. Then the only possibilities left are (b,b+a) and (c,c+a). We know that we have not covered b or c. Actually, we haven’t covered b+a either (since a>0 and a\ne c).

To be more systematic, we have to see what the possible equalities are between the various numbers. We know that a,b and $c$ are distinct. Also, a+b, b+c and a+c are distinct (subtract them from a+b+c). So the only possible equalities are things like a=b+c, Moreover, only one such equality can hold, since the number that equals the sum must be the biggest of the three. So let’s suppose WLOG that b\ne a+c and c\ne a+b. Then the pairs (a,a+b), (b,a+b), (a,a+c) and (c,a+c) have only the obvious equalities. The only way of blocking all four of these paths is to take a+b and a+c. But that leaves the path (b,b+c). (It’s possible that a=b+c here, but we were forced not to block a.)

The last vertex of each p_i is a vertex of weight n-1 that has 0 at the end. From each p_i, 1\le i\le n-1, we can create a path p'_i from 0^{n+1} to 1^{n+1} by following p_i until the last vertex, which is of the form v0 where $v$ is a sequence of weight n-1, then jumping to v1, and then 1^{n+1}. From p_n, we create p'_n by following p_n to 1^n0 and then going to 1^{n+1}. Removing the internal vertices of all these paths, we are at least left with the n-cube containing all vertices of the form v1, except n-1 of the vertices of weight n. Say, the vertex of weight n that is not taken is 01^{n}. Then we can add another path p'_{n+1} as follows: 0^{n+1}, 010^{n-1}, 01^20^{n-2},\ldots,01^{n-1}0,01^n,1^{n+1}.

It is possible for there to be paths of length 1 which have no extension to a path of length 2 (say, a_1 isn’t in M, but a_1+a_i belongs to M for each i>1). But we can construct a path of length 2 as follows: let a_j be largest element such that a_j is not in M. Suppose there is no extension of a_j to a path of length 2 (i.e., a_i+a_j is in M for each i other than j). Consider two cases; if there is some n<a_j in M, we can consider the n-1 remaining jumps and at most n-2 points remaining in M, resolving the problem inductively. Otherwise, there is no n<a_j in M; now, let a_1 be the smallest element other than a_j. Since it cannot be that a_1=a_j+a_k for any k, it follows that a_i is not in M (all the elements of M are accounted for as being of the form a_j+a_k). Let a_2 be the smallest element which is neither a_1 nor a_j; then a_1+a_2 can't have the form a_j+a_k for any k: it can't be either a_j+a_1 or a_j+a_2, and since a_1<a_j, a_1+a_2<a_j+a_k when a_k is anything else.

Then the question becomes: is there always a path/sum pair that will satisfy our while loop condition?

write “j” if you have a jump, “m” if there is a point of M, and “x” if there is both a jump and a point of M (situation which we want to avoid), and forget about the other points for the moment.

Suppose we start from a grasshopper trajectory, represented by a string of j, m, and x. We want to permute the jump lengths in order to cancel as many “x” as possible, since our aim is a string of just “j” and “m”.

Sometimes it is useful to exchange two successive jumps in order to diminish the number of “x”, i.e. to make changes like:

Here the we may have n+1 blocking elements and the above is not true
However this can be fixed because if we have n+1 elements blocking the n set and its sums then then we have no elements left to block the one remaining element and we can easily get the desired sums by taking that element and the sums contianing it now we can continue as before and we must remove the n set.

However it must be removed for every n subset of the n+1 elements then but that means we must remove every n sum. However since every n sum can be represented by subtracting an element from the sum of all n+1 elements and each of the n+1 elements are different then the n sums must be n+1 different elements and we must bloc all of them with M but M has only n elements so we are done with the induction.

Let's try to start our induction by working out which of these is to be missed.

My first thought was that we have n intervals whose lengths add up to s, so there must be one of them whose length is less than the average of the a_i. I hoped that this was the one that should be skipped. But that isn't always true. Take A = (9, 10, 11, 30) and M = (11, 30, 49).

Unfortunately, there seems to be a small proliferation of cases, which may mean that a proper inductive extension of this argument would either be a bit complicated, or require a better argument.

Split the a_i into b_1,b_2 so that b_1,b_1+b_2 is a path, b_1+b_2 is maximal among second terms of paths of length 2, and b_1 is maximal among initial elements of paths of length 2 with second terms of length b_1+b_2. Let c_1<c_2<…<c_{n-2} be the remaining elements.

Now suppose that b_1+b_2+c_i is in M for each i. Then this accounts for all but one element of M. Consider b_1+c_1; first, suppose b_1+c_1 is not in M. Then c_1<b_2; if also b_1+c_1+c_2 not in M, we are done. So suppose b_1+c_1+c_2 is in M. If b_2<b_1 then c_1+c_2+b_2 is also not in M, and we are done. If b_1<b_2 then b_2 is in M, which means b_2=b_1+c_1+c_2. Then c_1+b_2 cannot be in M, so c_1<b_1, and therefore again c_1+c_2+b_2<b_1+c_j+b_2 for any j other than 1 or 2, and c_1+c_2+b_2 cannot be b_1+c_j+b_2 for j either 1 or 2.

So we deal with the remaining case, where b_1+c_1 does belong to M. Then c_1 does not belong to M, and neither does c_1+b_2, so c_1<b_1. Then c_1+b_2+c_2<b_1+b_2+c_j for any j, so if c_1+b_2+c_2 is in M then it must be that b_1=b_2+c_2. Then c_2 and c_2+b_1 are in M, so c_2<b_2, so also c_2+b_1+c_1 are not in M, so this is a path of length 3.",case split,,,,,egbotdont

Now how many elements of M' are less than \sum_{i=1}^{n-2} b_i ? By the lemma we can assume that it is at most n-3. Thus the element m_{n-1} (which we removed from M to create M') is larger than every partial sum \sum_{i=1}^{l} b_i for 0<l<n-2.

By considerations in 112 all of the partial sums up to this point should avoid M. There are three elements left b_{n-2}, b_{n-1} and a_j. We may assume that \sum_{j=1}^{n-3} b_j + b_{n-2} \in M.

Moreover, we could then try to add on one of the other remaining elements instead. Thus there must be collisions with M regardless of how you add these 3 remaining elements.

In particular there are at most k mines in the interval [0,s+a_{k+1}] and at most k-1 mines in the right open interval [0,s+a_{k+1}). Let s' = s+ a_{k+1}. Then, from the above observations for some 1 <= i <= k+1, s'-a_i is not a mine and the interval [0,s'-a_i] has at most $k-1$ mines.
